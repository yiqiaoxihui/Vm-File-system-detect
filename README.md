a c program for detecting VM file system.

Require:

gcc4.0+
libguest

mysql
apache

Better way to building:
using codeblock to open this work
running to bulid and creat exec file

you need Contorller for add vm and so on which is avaiable at https://github.com/yiqiaoxihui/web-of-vm-filesystem-detect

Thank you!
